<b><u>FAQs (that no one asked)</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Who are you? </b>
<br> 
<b>A.</b> Barkha. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What do you want?</b>
<br> 
<b>A.</b> I'm doing an SEO certification and reaching out to webmasters to analyze their websites as an SEO-Auditing service. I'm doing this for free right now to build a portfolio and add referrals so that people stop asking me the next question. 
<br>
<br> 
<b>Q. You don't have many LinkedIn connections. Do you have ANY friends at all?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> *Awkward Silence*
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Why did you choose my website? </b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> I'm reaching out to websites that I think could gain through my inputs. <br> I have already done a short analysis and have found that the Titles and Descriptions are to not utilizing Google's guidelines for SEO Practices. That is mainly what I'll be advising for. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. 'MUST' I pay you?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> No. Like I said... I'm building a portfolio/case studies.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. 'CAN' I pay you?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> If you insist. :D
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What do I have to do?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Just give me a green flag to let me know that you are interested in sharing the outputs of my analysis.
<br> You just have to hear out my suggestions. If you like them and they make sense, you can use them on your website and say nice things about me in return. 
<br> If you don't use anything... that's okay too. It's not like I can haunt you, right?
<br> (...not while I'm alive.) :D
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Am I being scammed?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> No, silly! I just need a recommendation. You get the suggestions and save time while I get to gloat that I'm a useful person. There's no way you can be scammed unless you like sharing OTPs with strangers on the internet. Do you? :D
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What if I don't want your work? </b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Thatâ€™s okay. I'm just looking to grow and improve. We can still connect on LinkedIn without this exchange while I look for other opportunities. I'm thankful anyway!
