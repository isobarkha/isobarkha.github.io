<b><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Who are you? </b>
<br> 
<b>A.</b> Barkha. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What do you want?</b>
<br> 
<b>A.</b> I'm doing an SEO certification and reaching out to webmasters to analyze their websites as an SEO-Auditing service. I'm doing this for free right now to build a portfolio and add referrals so that people stop asking me the next question. 
<br>
<br> 
<b>Q. You don't have many LinkedIn connections. Do you have ANY friends at all?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> *Awkward Silence*
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Why did you choose my website? </b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> I'm reaching out to websites that could utilize my inputs because they seem to have minimal work done in this area <br> I have already put your website through the first audit step and found areas on your website that could be improved according to google's guidelines for better search ranking. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. 'MUST' I pay you?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> No. Like I said... I'm building a portfolio/case studies.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What do I have to do?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Just give me a green flag to let me know that you are interested in sharing the outputs of my analysis. I will not ask for access of your website in ANY form. 
<br>I will ONLY study the publicly available knowledge that you have already published. 
<br>You just have to hear out my suggestions. If you like them and they make sense, you can use them on your website and say nice things about me in return. 
<br> If you don't use anything... that's okay too. It's not like I can haunt you, right?<br>
(...not while I'm alive.) :D
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. Am I being scammed?</b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> No, silly! I just need a recommendation. You get the suggestions of an expert and I get the experience of being able to help you. There's no way you can be scammed unless you like sharing OTPs with strangers on the internet. Do you? :D
<br>
<br>
<b>Q. What if I don't want your work? </b>
<br>
<b>A.</b> Thatâ€™s okay. I'm just looking to grow and improve. We can still connect on LinkedIn without this exchange while I look for other opportunities. I'm thankful anyway!
